# Smart-Persian-Product-Search-Attribute-Semantic-Based-E-commerce-Search-Engine
This project provides a Smart Persian Product Search system designed for e-commerce platforms. It enables users to find products accurately and quickly, even with ambiguous, incomplete, or imprecise queries, by combining: 

Semantic search using sentence embeddings (Sentence Transformers)

Attribute-based matching (gender, size, color, material, subcategory)

Lexical keyword scoring to boost relevance

Synonym mapping for Persian-specific variations

This system is optimized for Persian online shops, where product naming and attributes often vary, and users struggle to find the right item efficiently.
